\section{Introduction}

Since the early works of (el que libeskind dice que habló de
eso primero) and \cite{1976MNRAS.174..695L}, the observed anisotropic
distribution of satellite galaxies in the Local Group has been a key
point in the discussion of galaxy formation models within $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. These pioneer papers described that the then known satellite
galaxies of the Milky May (MW) were distributed roughly following the plane
that contained the Magelanic clouds and their stellar tails. This
anisotropic distribution was further studied in the work of \cite{}Pawlowski
et. al. (2012), where they included all the known MW satellite galaxies (XXX
more than in the original Lynden-Bell paper) as well as some MW globular
clusters, and found that they are all contained in what they call a
"Vast Plane Of Satellites" (VPOS). This structure is around 30kpc thick and
is perpendicular to the stellar disc of the MW galaxy. This plane of
satellites was considered a rarity until the PAndAS survey of the
Andromeda (M31) galaxy and its halo (missing reference on the survey)
provided a complete sample of the satellite galaxy population (above a
XXXX magnitude) of our neighboring galaxy, allowing their consistent distance
estimations (Conn et al. 2012). In a groundbreaking work, Ibata et
al. (2013) found that 15 out of the 30 satellites are in a planar
structure that is 15kpc thick and has an extension of 400kpc.
Additionally, from line of sight velocity measurements, they
found that the structure has an apparent coherent rotation, with the
satellites south of M31 moving away from us and those north of M31
coming towards us. This apparent organized rotation of satellite galaxies was also
statistically found to occur in diametrically opposed 
pairs of satellites from the SDSS (Ibata et al. 2014), although this
results were contested in a follow up paper by Cuatun et al. (2014).  

These discoveries of the planes in M31 and the MW were followed by the
remark from Shaya et al. (2013) that the other satellite galaxies in
M31 could be part of a second plane, further reinforcing the idea that
satellites in the local group are not isotropically distributed.
Despite the challenges in estimating distances to the satellites
galaxies, Tully et al. managed to go beyond the local group and found
two planes of satellites galaxies in Centaurus A, making a clearer
case for the planes of satellites: in all the galaxies where distance
measurements could be performed evidence of satellite planar
structures have been found.\\

These observed planes and their apparent co-rotation seem to challenge
current galaxy formation models (Pawlowski et al. 2014).
\cite{2012MNRAS.424...80P} compared the kinematic structure of the MW
satellites against DM only simulation of high resolution halos from
the Via Lactea and Aquarius projects and could not find find a similar
kinematic structure (i.e. the orbital poles of the MW satellites) in
the simulations. Additionally, a few months after the discovery of the
M31 plane of satellites, Bahl and Baumgardt (2013) looked for similar
structures in the MilleniummII dark matter only cosmological
simulations, and found that planar structures are common (they found
them in around 2 per cent of host halos). Nevertheless these results
were contradicted by the works of Ibata el al. (2014) and Pawlowski et
al. (2014) who, analyzing the same cosmological simulations with
methods closer to those used to analyze the observational data, found
that planar structures such as that observed in M31 are extremely rare
(less than 0.02 per cent or 0.004 per cent respectively). But
satellite galaxies are not particularly good tracers of the underlying
dark matter structure (Sawala 2014), and indeed anisotropic
distributions of the satellites have been found in the APOSTOLE
simulations that include baryonic physics \citep{2016MNRAS.457.1931S},
although the Milky Way remains an extreme case. These results were
contested by \cite{2015ApJ...815...19P} who claim that the
anisotropies found are a product of using a metric that ignores the
radial position of the galaxies. %Sawalla et al. 2014
In CLUES, a high resolution constrained Local Group simulation,
Gillet et al. (2015) found M31-like planes but again, the observed M31 plane
remains an extreme case, and this seems to be corroborated by Cautun
et al. (2015), who, despite finding a great variety of planes in
simulations remarks that the observed M31 plane has an "unusually large
radial extent".\\  

In addition to these plane-finding efforts in cosmological simulations,
many works have focused on the possible formation processes that led
to planar structures and on the alignments  of these structures with
the cosmic web. In a pioneer work \cite{2011MNRAS.411.1525L} measured
the infall direction of satellites in a DM only constrained simulation of one pair
of LG halos and found that there is a definite infall direction. 
% but it's not quantified in terms of the cosmic web.
Using cosmological dark matter only simulations
\cite{2014MNRAS.443.1274L} showed that the preferential infall
direction was along cosmic filaments, result that was also obtained by 
\cite{2015ApJ...799..212L}. This result was further
confirmed by \cite{2015MNRAS.450.2727T}, who measure the angle between
satellites and the direction defined by filaments (Bissous filament
finder) to find a signal both in the SDSS galaxy catalog and in the
semi-analytic galaxies in the Millennium Simulation. Additionally, 
an analysis of the cosmic flow data set by Libeskind et al. (2015) 
reveals that four out of the fives satellite planes observed in the 
Local Group are aligned with a filament. 
Additionally, \cite{2016arXiv160601516L} use the SDSS DR10 catalog to study galaxy pairs and find that satellites tend to accumulate towards the companion galaxy: There
are up to $\sim 10\%$ more satellites in the space between the pair
than expected from an uniform distribution. 

Early filamentary accretion has been proposed as the formation mechanism for the Andromeda thin plane of satellites (Buck et al 2015), with early formed galaxies accreting their mass via cold thin filaments. 
This formation mechanism results naturally in thin planes, but a follow up work shows that these are not kinematically coherent structures (Buck et al. 2015). These results are from dark matter only simulations, so it would be interesting to see if they still hold for simulations that include baryonic physics, since it was shown by Gonzales et al 2015 that satellites acrreted via filaments are destroyed faster than those that are not. 

In a more general numerical study,   
\cite{2016arXiv160501728S} use the eagle simulation to study the
alignment of satellites with respect to the central galaxy. They find
a weak alignment. Around $20\%$ of the systems have a misalignment
angle larger than the value observed for the Milky Way. 


Planes in simulations tend to be transient structures (not
kinematically coherent) and that poses two problems: one is why do we
see planes in all the galaxies were we can actually make the
measurements if they are transient? Problem with the MW plane for which
some of the dwarfs have proper motion measurements. Another problem:
explicación de Buck 2015 sería rara entonces...


\section{Numerical Setup}

\subsection{Illustris simulation}

In this work we use the publicly available results from the Illustris
simulation (Vogelsberger et al. 2014). This cosmological simulation, performed using
the quasi-Lagrangian code AREPO, follows the coupled evolution of dark
matter and gas, and includes parametrizations to account for the effects of
gas cooling, photoionization, star formation, stellar feedback, black
hole and super massive black hole feedback. Vogelsberger et al. 2014 use a $75 Mpc/h$
simulation box, with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology initial conditions
starting at a redshift $z=127$ and consistent with WMAP-9 measurments.

\subsection{Sample Selection}

We select all halos with maximum circular velocities in the
range 150 km s$^{-1}$ $<V_{\rm max}<$ 350 km s$^{1}$.
We exclude sub-halos from this selection.
From this set we construct a sample of pairs as follows.
For each halo $A$ we find its closest halo $B$, if halo $A$ is also
the closest to halo $B$, the two halos are considered as a pair. 
Another way to phrase this selection is that pairs do not have
neighbors closer than the pair's distance.
We exclude the pairs that are closer than
There are $53$ pairs with those conditions in the simulation.

We extract from the simulation spheres of $2$ \hMpc  in radius around
the pair's center of mass. 
We use this information to exclude all the pairs that have separations
smaller than the sum  of their virial radii, i.e. we exclude
interacting pairs. 
This reduces to $49$ the number of pairs in the sample.

We count the number of galaxies with $M_V<-9$ inside the virial
radius of each halo, including the central galaxy.
We only keep pairs where both halos have 5 bright galaxies at least. 
This reduces the sample to $24$ pairs. 
We call this sample the Full Sample.

From the Full Sample we build a second sample based on the pairs' kinematics. 
Figure \ref{fig:samples} shows the co-moving separation and relative
speed between the two halos in the pair.
The stars in the Figure represent the pairs with a separation in the
range $0.75\hMpc <R_{AB}< 1.50\hMpc$ and relative velocity in the
range $V_{AB}>100$ km s$^{-1}$, which are close to the Local Group
Observed values.
We call this sample the LG Sample.

The number of pairs in the Full Sample is consistent with previous
calculations. 
\cite{ForeroRomero2013} performed a study of the LG kinematics using a
cosmological N-body simulation as a benchmark. 
In their study, using criteria similar to ours to define the Full
Sample, they found 1923 pairs in a volume of $250^3$ $h^{-3}$
Mpc$^{3}$. 
With the same number density we expect to find $52$ pairs in the
volume of the Illustris simulation, which is very close to the actual
number of $49$ pairs.

In the same study they found 158 pairs with broad kinematic
characteristics, similar to the definition of our LG sample. 
This represents a reduction of a factor of $12$ from their General
Sample. 
With those numbers in mind we would expect to keep at least $4$ pairs
in the Illustris volume. 
Given that our conditions are slightly more relaxed (we do not ask for
isolation criteria from massive halos) we end up with a larger sample
size, but still consistent with the fact that LG-like pairs are
scarce.  
%no me es muy claro este ultimo parrafo. En nuestros samples pasamos de 49 a 24 (o sea se redujo en un factor 2 en vez de un factor 12)

\subsection{Cosmic Web environment}
%me parece que la palabra "place" puede ser confusa. 
We place the pairs in our sample into the cosmic web as quantified by
the deformation tensor.
\citep{2007MNRAS.375..489H,2009MNRAS.396.1815F}.
This method computes a cartesian grid the tensor $T_{ij}$,
\begin{equation}
T_{ij} \equiv \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial r_i \partial r_j}
\end{equation}
%
where $\phi$ is a pseudo-gravitational potential that follows the
Poisson equation $\nabla^2\phi=-\delta$ and the $r_i$ coordinates
correspond to a cartesian system with $i=1,2,3$. 

This tensor is and symmetric and can be diagonalized.
Its eigenvalues ($\lambda_1 > \lambda_2 > \lambda_3$) and
corresponding eigenvectors ($\hat{e}_1$, $\hat{e}_2$, $\hat{e}_3$)
define the degree and direction of stability around the neighborhood
where the tensor was computed. 
This allows the classification of that region either as a peak,
filaments, sheets and voids in the case of three, two, one or zero
eigenvalues larger than a given threshold $\lambda_{th}$.

In this study we compute these eigenvalues and eigenvectors over the
dark matter component of the Illustris-3 simulation on a cubic mesh of
$74$ cells on a side. 
This resolution corresponds to $\sim 1$ Mpc h.
We interpolate the DM density on that mesh using a Cloud-In-Cell (CIC)
scheme. 
We proceed to smooth the density field with a gaussian window with a
physical scale equal to the cell size. 

We choose this interpolation and smoothing scale for two reasons.
First, because it corresponds to the typical pair separation in our
sample.
Second, because it allows a direct comparison with other results in
the literature that used the same methodology to quantify the cosmic
web environment for Local Group pairs in a cosmological context
\citep{ForeroRomero2013,2015ApJ...799...45F}.  

\subsection{Characterization of spatial distributions}
\label{Method}
In this paper, our aim is to study alignments: of the
satellite population with the cosmic web, of the dark matter halos
with the axis that unites them, etc... To do this, we fitted a triaxial spheroid to both the satellite (bright) and the dark matter (dark) subhalo distributions, to get both their semi-major and semi-minor axis.
With this geometrical information we can study the alignments of the two distributions with the cosmic web, and also with the vector that unites the halo pair that host these substructures. %Jaime, falta el plot de alineaciones con la cosmic web

\section{Results}
\label{Results}

Some papers claim that once baryonic physics is included more planar distributions are found.
First we investigate if there is a difference in the bright and dark distribution in terms of their flatness.
In Figure \ref{fig:StreamPlaneOrbit} we can see that indeed the bright distribution is flatter than the dark distribution.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{axratio_dark_bright.pdf}\\
\caption{Axis ratio of luminous satellites versus the axis ratio for
  dark subhalos.}
\label{fig:StreamPlaneOrbit}
\end{figure}

We then try to fit planes to both the dark and bright distributions in order to test if it is indeed easier to find thinner planes in the bright distribution. 
We find that the bright planes are thinner.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{plane_width.pdf}\\
\caption{Plane width for the best planes in the luminious and dark cases.}
\label{fig:plane_width}
\end{figure}
But is there a physical reason for that? Apparently not, since the thinness of the fitted planes seems to be only due to number of objects: number of bright satellites is smaller than of dark sub-halos and that results naturally in thinner fitted planes.
%pregunta para Jaime: en tu código dark quiere decir dm only subhalos o todos los subhalos (dm only y bright)?
%podríamos hacer como un test extra el plot que yo tenía en mis plot de antes, que es cojer al azar entre los dark un numero de subhalos igual al de bright y ver los anchos de los planos.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{plane_width_n_dark.pdf}\\
\caption{Plane width as a function of objects used to find the plane.}
\label{fig:plane_width_nobjects}
\end{figure}

A second test is to look if there is any evidence of alignments between the distribution of satellites and the axis that unites the main halos that form the pair.

\section{Discussion}
Difference between bright and dark distributions are only due to number.\\
We find significant alignments between distributions and H1H2 axis. But this alignments are the opposite as the one observed for the Local Group!!!

%Simulation Details

%We follow the coupled dynamics of DM and gas with the robust, accurate, and efficient quasi-Lagrangian code AREPO. In this approach, an unstructured Voronoi tessellation of the simulation volume allows for dynamic and adaptive spatial discretization, where a set of mesh generating points are moved along with the gas flow. This mesh is used to solve the equations of ideal hydrodynamics using a second order, finite volume, directionally un-split Godunov-type scheme, with an exact Riemann solver. The gravitational force is calculated with a split Tree-PM approach, where long-range forces are calculated from a particle-mesh method, and short-range forces are calculated with a hierarchical octree algorithm. Our galaxy formation model is based on the inclusion of several additional astrophysical processes:

%    Gas cooling and photo-ionization: the cooling function is calculated as a function of gas density, temperature, metallicity, UV radiation field, and AGN radiation field. The UV background is a spatially uniform, time dependent field for which reionization completes at z~6.
%    Star formation and ISM model: our subgrid model for the ISM puts dense gas above 0.13 particles per cubic cm on an effective equation of state, assuming a two-phase medium of cold clouds embedded in a tenuous, hot phase. Star formation occurs stochastically following the KS-law and with a Chabrier IMF.
%    Stellar evolution: stellar populations return mass to the gas phase through stellar winds and supernova. We track and follow the rates associated with SN Ia, SN II, and AGB stars. The evolving abundances of nine elements (H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, Fe) are independently considered and advected.
%    Stellar feedback: we employ a kinetic stellar feedback scheme, which generates a wind with velocity scaled to the local DM dispersion, and mass loading inferred from the available SN energy for energy-driven winds (1051 erg per SNII). The metal enrichment of winds is modulated such that only 40% of local ISM metals are driven away by these galactic winds.
%    Black holes and SMBH feedback: we seed new BHs with a mass of 105 solar masses in all FoF groups which become more massive than 7x1010 solar masses. The feedback of SMBHs includes both quasar-mode and radio-mode regimes, and a consideration of the radiation field of AGNs, which heats surrounding halo gas, modifying its ionization state and net cooling rate.

%The initial conditions assume a LCDM cosmology consistent with WMAP-9 measurements, from which a linear power spectrum is used to create a random realization in a periodic box with side length 75 Mpc/h = 106.5 Mpc, at a starting redshift of 127. A series of simulations are run at different resolutions, and a second set is run with only dark matter. The main simulation initially has 18203 = 6,028,568,000 hydrodynamic cells, and the same number of DM particles and MC tracers (see table for more details, including mass resolutions and gravitational softening lengths). Evolving the main simulation to z=0 used 8,192 compute cores, a peak memory of 25 TB, and 19 million CPU hours.

  Abstract                 = {We present compelling evidence for the complexity of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. By disentangling three different stellar subpopulations in its red giant branch, we are able to study in detail the dependence between kinematics and metallicity. A well-defined ordering in velocity dispersion, spatial concentration, and metallicity is evident in the subpopulations. We also present evidence for a significant misalignment between the angular momentum vectors of the old- and intermediate-age populations. According to the Hubble Space Telescope measurement of Fornax's proper motion, this corresponds to counter-rotation. These ingredients are used to construct a novel evolutionary history of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, characterized as a late merger of a bound pair.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel pair of numerical models of the interaction history between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) and our Milky Way (MW) in light of recent high-precision proper motions from the Hubble Space Telescope. Given the updated velocities, cosmological simulations of hierarchical structure formation favour a scenario where the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are currently on their first infall towards our Galaxy. We illustrate here that the observed irregular morphology and internal kinematics of the Magellanic System (in gas and stars) are naturally explained by interactions between the LMC and SMC, rather than gravitational interactions with the MW. These conclusions provide further support that the MCs are completing their first infall to our system. In particular, we demonstrate that the Magellanic Stream, a band of H i gas trailing behind the Clouds 150° across the sky, can be accounted for by the action of LMC tides on the SMC before the system was accreted by the MW. We further demonstrate that the off-centre, warped stellar bar of the LMC, and its one-armed spiral can be naturally explained by a recent direct collision with its lower mass companion, the SMC. Such structures are key morphological characteristics of a class of galaxies referred to as Magellanic Irregulars, the majority of which are not associated with massive spiral galaxies. We infer that dwarf?dwarf galaxy interactions are important drivers for the morphological evolution of Magellanic Irregulars and can dramatically affect the efficiency of baryon removal from dwarf galaxies via the formation of extended tidal bridges and tails. Such interactions are not only important for the evolution of dwarf galaxies but also have direct consequences for the build-up of baryons in our own MW, as LMC-mass systems are believed to be the dominant building blocks of MW-type haloes.},

  Abstract                 = {We present initial results from a wide-field photometric survey of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy. The focus here is on a small overdensity of stars located approximately 17' (670 pc in projection) from the center of Fornax. Based on imaging data in both V and I bands down to V~21, the dimensions of the feature are ~1.7‧×3.2‧ (68×128 pc) with an average surface brightness of 25.8 mag arcsec-2 in V. A follow-up analysis using the deep B- and R-band data obtained by Stetson, Hesser, & Smecker-Hane indicates that the overdensity is apparently dominated by a relatively young stellar population with an age of ~2 Gyr, though the current data do not rule out the presence of older stars. Our preferred interpretation is that the overdensity represents shell structure in the Fornax dSph galaxy, a phenomenon previously unseen in dwarf galaxies. The shell may be the remnant of a merger with Fornax of a smaller, gas-rich system that occurred approximately 2 Gyr ago. The comparatively recent star formation seen in some dSph and dE galaxies may then also be the result of infall of small relatively gas-rich systems.},

  Abstract                 = {We have obtained deep photometry in two 1° × 1° fields covering the close pair of dwarf spheroidal galaxies Leo IV and Leo V and part of the area in between. From the distribution of likely red giant branch (RGB) and horizontal-branch (HB) stars in the data set, we find that both Leo IV and Leo V are significantly larger than indicated by previous measurements based on shallower data. With a half-light radius of rh = 4farcm6 ± 0farcm8 (206 ± 36 pc) and rh = 2farcm6 ± 0farcm6 (133 ± 31 pc), respectively, both systems are now well within the physical size bracket of typical dwarf spheroidal Milky Way satellites. Both are also found to be significantly elongated with an ellipticity of epsilon ~= 0.5, a characteristic shared by many of the fainter (MV > - 8) Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. The large spatial extent of our survey allows us to search for extra-tidal features in the area between the two dwarf galaxies with unprecedented sensitivity. The spatial distribution of candidate RGB and HB stars in this region is found to be non-uniform at the ~3? level. Interestingly, this substructure is aligned along the direction connecting the two systems, indicative of a possible "bridge" of extra-tidal material. Fitting the stellar distribution with a linear Gaussian model yields a significance of 4? for this overdensity, a most likely FWHM of ~16 arcmin, and a central surface brightness of sime32 mag arcsec-2. We investigate different scenarios to explain the close proximity of Leo IV and Leo V, and the possible tidal bridge between them. Orbit calculations demonstrate that the two systems cannot share the exact same orbit, while a compromise orbit does not approach the Galactic center more than ~160 kpc, rendering it unlikely that they are remnants of a single disrupted progenitor. A comparison with cosmological simulations shows that a chance collision between unrelated subhalos is negligibly small. Given their relative distance and velocity, Leo IV and Leo V could be a bound "tumbling pair," if their combined mass exceeds (8 ± 4) × 109 M sun. The scenario of an internally interacting pair that fell into the Milky Way together appears to be the most viable explanation for this close celestial companionship.},
